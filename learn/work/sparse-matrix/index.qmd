## Introduction

`r article_req_pkgs(pkgs)`

This article demonstrates how we can use a sparse matrix in tidymodels.

## Example data

The data we will be using in this article is a larger sample of the [small_fine_foods](https://modeldata.tidymodels.org/reference/small_fine_foods.html) data set from the [modeldata](https://modeldata.tidymodels.org) package. The [raw data](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html) was sliced down to 100,000 rows, tokenized, and saved as a sparse matrix. Data has been saved as [reviews.rds](reviews.rds) and the code to generate this data set is found at [generate-data.R](generate-data.R). This file takes up around 1MB compressed, and around 12MB once loaded into R. This data set is encoded as a sparse matrix from the Matrix package; if we were to turn it into a dense matrix, it would take up 3GB.

```{r}
#| label: "read-data"
reviews <- readr::read_rds("reviews.rds")
reviews |> head()
```

## Modeling

We start by loading tidymodels and the sparsevctrs package. The sparsevctrs package includes some helper functions that will allow us to more easily work with sparse matrices in tidymodels.

```{r}
#| label: "load-packages"
library(tidymodels)
library(sparsevctrs)
```

While sparse matrices now work in parsnip, recipes, and workflows directly, we can use rsample's sampling functions as well if we turn it into a tibble. The usual `as_tibble()` would turn the object to a dense representation, greatly expanding the object size. However, sparsevctrs' `coerce_to_sparse_tibble()` will create a tibble with sparse columns, which we call a **sparse tibble**.

```{r}
#| label: "sparse-tibble"
reviews_tbl <- coerce_to_sparse_tibble(reviews)
reviews_tbl
```

Despite this tibble containing 15,000 rows and a little under 25,000 columns, it only takes up marginally more space than the sparse matrix.

```{r}
#| label: "sizes"
lobstr::obj_size(reviews)
lobstr::obj_size(reviews_tbl)
```

The outcome `SCORE` is currently encoded as a double, but we want it to be a factor for it to work well with tidymodels.

```{r}
#| label: "outcome-factor"
reviews_tbl <- reviews_tbl |>
  mutate(SCORE = factor(SCORE, levels = c(1, 0), labels = c("great", "other")))
```

Since `reviews_tbl` is now a tibble, we can use `initial_split()` as we usually do.

```{r}
#| label: "data-splitting"
set.seed(1234)

review_split <- initial_split(reviews_tbl)
review_train <- training(review_split)
review_test <- testing(review_split)

review_folds <- vfold_cv(review_train)
```

Next, we will specify our workflow. Since we are showcasing how sparse data works in tidymodels, we will stick to a simple lasso regression model. These models tend to work well with sparse predictors. `penalty` has been set to be tuned.

```{r}
#| label: "workflow"
rec_spec <- recipe(SCORE ~ ., data = review_train)

lm_spec <- logistic_reg(penalty = tune()) |>
  set_engine("glmnet")

wf_spec <- workflow(rec_spec, lm_spec)
```

With everything in order, we can now evaluate several different values of `penalty` with `tune_grid()`.

```{r}
#| label: "tune-grid"
tune_res <- tune_grid(wf_spec, review_folds)
```

Despite the size of the data, this code runs quite quickly due to the sparse encoding of the data. Once the tuning process is done, then we can look at the performance for different values of regularization.

```{r}
#| label: "autoplot"
autoplot(tune_res)
```

We can now finalize the workflow and fit the final model on the training data set.

```{r}
#| label: "finalize-workflow"
wf_final <- finalize_workflow(
  wf_spec, 
  select_best(tune_res, metric = "roc_auc")
)

wf_fit <- fit(wf_final, review_train)
```

With this fitted model, we can now predict with a sparse tibble.

```{r}
#| label: "predict"
predict(wf_fit, review_test)
```

## Session information {#session-info}

```{r}
#| label: "si"
#| echo: false
small_session(pkgs)
```
